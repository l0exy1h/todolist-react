# React based Todo list

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I Built a web-based todo list using React, where the user can add a todo item, mark/unmark a todo item as done, and remove a todo item. This web application supports any display ratio and size and it supports mobile view.
